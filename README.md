#Objectives:
1. Find the min and max of a number set
2. Count the total of a number set
3. Find the average of a number set

We have a database full of students. The schema is as follows:
![](http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/sql-students.png)
Run `learn` to get started. Write your `SQL` in `lib/students.rb` to get the specs in `spec/student_spec.rb` to pass.

Note: Since it's a Ruby file, write your queries as strings inside each method already defined in `lib/students.rb` .
